# ArgoCD Manifests for OpenShift Tools

This repo contains manifests to deploy the following tools on any OpenShift cluster which has **ArgoCD** running.

**[Advanced Cluster Management](#acm---advanced-cluster-management)**<br>
**[Advanced Cluster Security (StackRox)](#acs---advanced-cluster-security)**<br>
**[Quay](#quay)**<br>

## Usage

To use the manifests here with ArgoCD follow the instructions below. Keep in mind that the following permission need to be set before usage, to give ArgoCD's required permissions:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:openshift-gitops:openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
```

> **_NOTE:_** To use the bash scripts you should login to the cluster with a cluster-admin user and also have ArgoCD installed and running on openshift-gitops namespace.
